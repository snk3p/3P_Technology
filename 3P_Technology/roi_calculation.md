# ROI Calculation — Knowledge Retention

**Assumptions (example)**:
- Average engineer fully-burdened cost: 8,000 dkk/month
- Typical project time savings: 5 days saved per project
- Company does 50 projects/year
- Average project size: 300 man-hours (~7.5 weeks of 40h)
- Value of 1 hour = 350 dkk (approx)

**Simple ROI calculation**:
- Hours saved per project: 5 days * 8h = 40h
- Annual hours saved = 40h * 50 = 2,000h
- Annual value = 2,000h * 350 dkk = 700,000 DKK.

**Costs**:
- Implementation (pilot + infra): DKK 298,750(one-time)
- Annual maintenance & LLM costs: 149,374 DKK./year

**Year-1 ROI**:
- Net benefit = 746,870 DKK - 298,748 DKK - 149,374 DKK = 298,748 DKK
- ROI = 100% of annualized implementation in first year.

We also compute risk-reduction value (knowledge retained vs lost). Use more precise salaries and project counts for real numbers.
